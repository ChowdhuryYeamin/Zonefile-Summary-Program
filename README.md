# Zonefile-Summary-Program

## Description:
This repository contains a C++ application designed to read DNS records from a file and summarize the count of each record type. It serves as a practical implementation to understand and process Zone files, commonly used in configuring DNS servers.

## Key Features:
DNS Record Parsing: Efficiently parses a provided file to extract DNS record information.
Record Type Counting: Counts occurrences of various DNS record types (e.g., A, MX, CNAME) within the file.
Alphabetical Sorting: Outputs the record types and their counts in an alphabetically sorted manner.
Command-Line Interface: Easy to use with command-line arguments for file input.

## Usage:
The program accepts a file path as a command-line argument, reads the DNS record entries, and prints a summary of record types found in the file along with their counts. The output is sorted alphabetically for easy readability.

## Technical Insights:
Implemented in C++ leveraging standard libraries for file processing and data handling.
Utilizes std::map for counting and sorting, ensuring efficient data management and output accuracy.
Demonstrates practical file I/O operations, string manipulation, and use of standard C++ containers.

## Purpose:
This project is a demonstration of basic file handling and data processing in C++, with a specific focus on parsing and summarizing structured data, as found in DNS zone files. It's an excellent showcase for individuals learning about both DNS configurations and C++ programming.
